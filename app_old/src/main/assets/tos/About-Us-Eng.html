    About Us
</p>
<p>
    <em> i-women – inspiring women </em>
    is a free mobile application that delivers a dynamic, interactive stream of real life stories of inspiration written by women from Myanmar and from across
    the world to women and girls living in Myanmar’s rural areas. <em>i-women app</em> seeks to inspire, foster self-belief in, and channel peer support to
    rural women to become leaders in their communities.
</p>
<p>
    UNDP Myanmar has been working to support women’s empowerment at local level through federations of Self-Reliant Groups (SRGs) which are expanding the role
    of women and girls in community development and local governance. The federation spans 2000 village women’s groups in 8 states and regions and connects
    over 22,500 women.

<p>
    <em>i-women – inspiring women </em>
    believes that inspiration is an essential component for the self-development of rural women – <em>“if she can do it, I can do it’’. </em>At the end of each
    inspirational story shared, there will be a couple of open-ended values based questions, which will spark an on-line and off-line debate on how to take
    actions based on the inspiration received.
</p>
<em>i-women – inspiring women </em>
<p>
    believes in the sequence that inspiration leads to thought and discussion, which then formulates into plans and actions. The
</p>
<em>i-women</em>
<em>app</em>
<p>
    will have several additional resources to support rural women to take their thoughts and discussion from plan to action.
